ECW/JP2 support is realized via native libraries compiled from the ECW SDK 3.3 .
As these have to be compiled for every platform the support is limited to
platforms where the libraries are available.

Currently included in OJ PLUS is support for the following combinations

Linux (32bit/64bit) with Java (32bit/64bit)
MacOSX with Java (32bit)
Windows (XP - 8.1 [32bit/64bit]) with Java (32bit)

NOTE: 64bit Java is currently _not_ supported on MacOSX and Windows.
