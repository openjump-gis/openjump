  - some icon modifications
  - place PLUS's Jump DBQuery plugin via xml properly in File menu, 
    added nice icon
  - lot's of minor mods to plugins so the integration into xml above 
    went more smoothly (e.g. enable check adding, icon setting,

    the use of ST_Estimated_Extent.
    Now, some data can be excluded from "zoom on layer", but it
    will always be seen after a zoom out or a pan.
  * Fix Layer : setFeatureCollection must not emit FeatureEvent
    if LayerManager.isFiringEvent is off.

2013-10-14 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
  * Small improvement in ZoomToSelectedItemsPlugIn : zoom level is

        Image (JAI)
    - readers should be able to open archives now and find worldfiles
      in there or in their basefolder
    - readers gather their supported formats now internally, so the file
      extension list has not to be hardcoded anymore. here's a list on my 

IOGraphicImageFactory: [jpg, bmp, wbmp, jpeg, png, gif]
JAIGraphicImageFactory: [bmp, fpx, jpg, pnm, wbmp, tif, jpeg, png, gif, tiff]
CommonsImageFactory: [jpeg, tif, icns, ico, pbm, xpm, jb2, rgbe, jbig2, pcx, 
psd, wbmp, tga, tiff, hdr, pam, xbm, jpg, bmp, pnm, png, ppm, dcx, pgm, gif]

  * Improved NoderPlugIn to be able to process features selected in several 
    layers and to make use of it in new plugins to be added in the mouse context 
    menu.
  * Add the following plugins in layer view mouse menu :

    https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3510832&group_id=118054&atid=679906
    NOTE: FeatureInfo is not updated, this is no simple issue to solve as schema modification
          replaces the whole featurecollection for the layer, which let's the layer loose selection
          and the attribute table loose the old feature object
    WORKAROUND: simply close and reopen it

    consistent as the item was renamed first (original name: "Transfer Attributes") 
    and then moved to a different menu (Edit Attributes -> Analysis), 
    so users would not find it without testing all functions.

      WKT editor had no effect on the geometry after validation.

2011-11-08 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * Fixed persistence of OpenProject / SaveProjectAs [ID 3434161]
      org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.file.open.SelectProjectFilesPanel
      org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.file.open.OpenProjectWizard
      com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.plugin.SaveProjectAsPlugIn
    * Internationalization of PasteItemsPlugIn and PasteLayerPlugIn

2011-11-07 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * Fixed AutoAssignPlugin [ID 3434648] and changed slightly its semantic
      unparsable number returns null instead of 0 for Integer or Double type

2011-11-06 sstein <sstein@geo.uzh.ch>
    * Fixed the SaveDatasetAs bug for MacOSX [ID 3428076].
      Now the input is accepted and, hence, a file is written.
      Testing fix on Windows on 7.Nov.2011 was positive. So I removed the 
      MacOSX specific function call for "SaveDatasetAsFile" that was used 
      as work around.
      Note, the solution itself is done by replacing Non-OSX workaround code
      for the Java bug 4528663 in FileDataSourceQueryChooser only. Changes in 
      other classes were for testing and code readability.
      
2011-11-05 sstein <sstein@geo.uzh.ch>
    * Added icons by Peppe for the following functions: 
      EditSelectedFeaturePlugIn, DeleteSelectedItemsPlugIN, 
      CombineSelectedFeaturesPlugIn, ExplodeSelectedFeaturesPlugIn,
      PasteItemsPlugIn, ReplicateSelectedItemsPlugIn,
      CopySelectedItemsPlugIn, PasteItemsAtPlugIn 
    
2011-11-03 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * Fixed bug id 3413805 by changing validateTree() to validate() in 
      LayerNameRenderer (don't understand why, though)
    * Fixed SaveDatasetsPlugin (throws a nullPointerException is the project
      includes a Datastore)
    * Small fix in SaveLayersWithoutDataSourcesPlugIn (change layerName.png
      to layerName.jml whe saving the layer as jml along with the project 

2011-10-31 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * New plugin com.vividsolutions.jump.plugin.edit.NoderPlugIn
      to replace LineNoderPlugIn (see also request 2333409). The new PlugIn :
      - preserve attributes
      - can process LineStrings AND polygons
      - can node OR split geometries
      - can interpolate z values on intersections
      
2011-10-29 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * Add a limit parameter (max number of features) in the addDataStore PlugIn
      as requested in Feature Request 3422848

2011-10-26 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * Add 3 Zoom Plugins from LayerView context menu : Zoom in, zoom out, 
      zoom center (prepared by Peppe)
    * DeleteDuplicateGeometriesPlugIn now create the result layer in Results,
      not in working directory.
    * Fix the i18n name of new BufferPlugIn menu item 

2011-10-18 sstein <sstein@geo.uzh.ch>
    * re-added the SaveDatasetAsFilePlugIn to be loaded in the layer context 
      menu if the system is MacOSX. This was done since under MacOSX the 
      SaveDatasetAsPlugIn is missing a text field to write the name of 
      the new file. Hence, the dialog could only be used for saving to an 
      existing dataset. Note, I did not replace one menu item with the other,
      since SaveDataSetAs can also write to a database (e.g. PostGIS).
      Changed:
      com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.JUMPConfiguration
      Added:
      com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.datasource.SaveDatasetAsFilePlugIn

2011-10-16 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * Workaround for bug 3418067 in LayerNamePanel of cloned windows
    * Add ReverseOrientationPlugIn (Feature Request 3277052) in LayerViewPanel 
      right-click menu

2011-10-15 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * Add CopySchemaPlugIn and PasteSchemaPlugIn from SkyJump

2011-10-12 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * Bug 3413619 : moving category up and down when there is only one

2011-10-12 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * Small improvement in LabelStyle (Label multipolygon on widest polygon)
    * Use new FeatureInstaller methods and exclude calls to MultiInputDialog
      in run method of plugins (see also feature request 3421958 & 3200485) :
      - LineNoderPlugIn
      - PolygonizerPlugIn
      - PrecisionReducerPlugIn
      - ExtractSegmentsPlugIn
      - AffineTransformationPlugIn

2011-10-08 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * Clean and improve AutoAssignAttributePlugIn

2011-10-02 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * Improved LabelStyle : adds a default value for vertical alignment
      (default is middle for areas and above for lines and points)
      and a horizontal position attribute distinct from horizontal alignment.
      See also Feature Request 3407229
      Now behaviour should be the following :
      Area
         Vertical alignment means above, below or middle of the bounding box
         Horizontal position means on the left, right or center of the bounding box
         Horizontal alignment can center, left-align or right-align the text.
             It is relative to the horizontal position.
      LineString
         Vertical alignment means above, below or on the line
         Horizontal position means endpoint of leftmost segment,
             endpoint of rightmost segment or longest segment
             leftmost/rightmost segments are end segments
         Horizontal alignment is left-aligned, centered or right-aligned on the
             first point, the last point or the longest segment
         Texts follow segment orientation except texts which are right-aligned
             on the left of the LineString or left-aligned on the right of the 
             LineString (these last texts are written horizontally)
      Points
         Vertical is above, below or on the point
         Horizontal position is on the left, right or middle of the point
         Horizontal alignment is ignored

2011-10-02 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * Improved UnionByAttribute to include Union, Dissolve and Merge function
      (+ use of new FeatureInstaller and MultiInputDialog function + more icons)

2011-09-30 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * ShapefileWriter now prompt the user to accept or not to truncate fields
      with more than 255 characters.
      A timestamp is used to avoid prompting the user if he has already accepted
      to truncate for less than 30 s (useful for batching shapefile outputs)
    * Fixed bug 3415409 : NoteStyle could not be deserialized
    
2011-09-27 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * New BufferPlugIn exposing all the parameters of JTS 1.12 library
      Uses classes and methods of the new MultiInputDialog framework
    * Add a patch to QueryDialog and LayerNameRenderer to get the Layer Color
      in the Simple Query tool

2011-09-25 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    * In MultiInputDialog showing Layer list in a JComboBox, selected
      layer was unreadable (black foreground and dard background)
      This should be fixed (may be due to a workaround Larry did to solve an old
      JRE problem)

2011-09-25 ede
  bugfix 2728360: Layer operations break the Undo Chain
  actually all plugins based on AbstractPlugIn have that behaviour if the do
    not reportNothingToUndoYet()
  disabled this in UndoableEditReceiver, now these plugins are simply ignored
    by undo

2011-09-24 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
  * Refactoring of Selection package : 
    - use generics in selection related classes instead of OpenJUMP CollectionMap
    - improve memory usage (initialize all lists with an array of size 1 instead
      of the default array size)
    - fix old bug 2792806
    
    Changed classes are :
    -com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.SelectionManager
    -com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.AbstractSelection
    -com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.FeatureSelection

    -com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.plugin.DeleteSelectedItemsPlugIn
  * Deprecate com.vividsolutions.jump.io.WKTWriter an use
    com.vividsolutions.jts.io.WKTWriter instead

2011-09-18 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>
  * Refactoring of EditTransaction class :
    - use Set instead of List to avoid time-consuming "if (!list.contains())" 
      operations
    - remove geometry cloning in addFeature and deleteFeature : save time and 
      memory. Hopefully, it will not break anything
    All in all, the speed improvement maybe 10x and the memory save 50%
    Change may slow down some operations, but I did not note it yet.

    measurements very easy without any additional menuitems and mouseclicks
    in the menu.

2011-01-19 Matthias Scholz <ms@jammerhund.de>
  * AdvancedMeasureOptionsPanel

    with an own JToggleButton implementation such as the DropDownToogleButton

2010-12-14 mmichaud <michael.michaud@free.fr>

  (i):   Create Bar Plot
  (ii):  Create Histogram
  (iii): Create Scatter Plot
  (iv):  Classify Attributes
  (v):   Calculate Mean and Variance per Class
  
  added all five new plugins/functions to the package
  org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.tools.statistics
  
2010-08-29 sstein <sstein@geo.uzh.ch>
  set OJ version to 1.4
  
2010-08-29 sstein <sstein@geo.uzh.ch>
  removed log4j 1.2.8 and added log4j 1.2.16
  
2010-08-26 sstein <sstein@geo.uzh.ch>
  added 4 functions for working with sextante rasters in (new) menu "Raster":  
  (i):   Create Lattice from Image
  (ii):  Create Polygon Grid from Image
  (iii): Profile Graph
  (iv):  Raster Color Editor
  
  Note, the profile graph creates a plot. So I added the JMathPlot library to
  the OJ lib folder.
  
  new packages with classes: 
  org.openjump.core.ui.color.*
  org.openjump.core.ui.plot.*
  org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.raster.*
  
2010-08-09 sstein <sstein@geo.uzh.ch>
  ESRI ASCII grids can now be read in as Sextante Raster. Alberto did send me the code
  for the changes (see JPP devel list)   
  
  changed classes:
  org.openjump.core.rasterimage.RasterImageLayer
  org.openjump.core.rasterimage.AddRasterImageLayerWizard
  org.openjump.core.rasterimage.SelectRasterImageFilesPanel
  
  new classes
  org.openjump.core.rasterimage.GridAscii  
  
2010-08-09 sstein <sstein@geo.uzh.ch>
  needed to revert the following change on 9.Aug.2010 6.35pm MT but 
  added back on Aug.10:
  tried to implement dynamic loading of images which decides based on used memory
  and size of the image/raster if the image is load into memory or just read from
  file each time pan/zoom is done.

  However, this needs more testing
  
  changed classes:
  org.openjump.core.rasterimage.RasterImageLayer
  
2010-08-02 sstein <sstein@geo.uzh.ch>
  changed access for Pirols RasterImageLayer class, since we need to store the image
  and the data separately. This way we can adjust the image values without changing
  the data. To scale image grey values for a better display a function was added to the
  RasterImageLayer class (e.g. while previously very small values -> 0 have been displayed
  as black pixels, they are now grey).
  
  I removed/renamed the function RasterImageLayer.getImage() to getImageForDisplay()
  to avoid that other programs work with the stretched/modified image. Hence, I also
  changed the access in the Sextante classes (e.g.: OpenJUMPSextanteRasterLayer).
  I tested Loading, Saving and ExtractSelectedPart briefly - so I hope it works.
  
  changed classes:
  org.openjump.core.rasterimage.RasterImageLayer
  org.openjump.core.rasterimage.AddRasterImageLayerWizard
  org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.layer.pirolraster.LoadSextanteRasterImagePlugIn
  org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.layer.pirolraster.SaveRasterImageAsImagePlugIn
  org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.layer.pirolraster.ExtractSelectedPartOfImage
  
  org.openjump.core.rasterimage.sextante.OpenJUMPSextanteRasterLayer
  note, the corresponding class needs also to be changed in the Sextante repository.
  
  Note, in general it is recommended to use OpenJUMPSextanteRasterLayer to do raster
  operations and not the RasterImageLayer class.

      Did some major changes for Intersect Polygon Layers PlugIn, to avoid
      malformed output polygons. The new version utilizes the Polygonizer
      and attributes are transferred automatically (i.e. no option anymore)

          Tried to identify why warping runs endless/crashes JUMP
          when layer contains only one point bug [1920024]
          (note this does not happen for polygons).
          I found the reason why it runs in a loop and added a check.
          However creating a triangle for the warping fails for the
          first time with only 1 point (since we can not create a
          triangle) but it works surprisingly for the 2nd time.
          I added therefore only a message to WarpingPanel that
          motivates the user to do a 2nd try.
          modified: com/vividsolutions/jump/warp/Triangulator.java
                                com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/warp/WarpingPanel.java

        * Added a VertexZValue style and internationalized the
          VertexXYLineSegment style

2007-08-21 beckerl <becker.larry@gmail.com>
        * Consolodated Label Style enhancements (from SkyJUMP).
        * Finished implementation of horizontal alignment in LabelStyle.
          Replaced the vertical alignment images (Above the line, etc.) with I18N text.
        * Added support for halo text. A halo is a surrounding outline in a
          contrasting color to improve readability when using a mixed background
        * Added support for hiding text below a specified scale.  This makes it possible
          to stop text from rendering when zoomed out too far to actually read it

2007-08-27 paul_d_austin <paul.austin@revolsys.com>
            * Added some getting methods to FileDataSourceQueryChooser for the
              new load dialog implementation.

          layer name in the file chooser

        * Bug fixed in LoadDatasetPlugIn : refresh the file list each time the
          plugin is called


2007-08-24 Andreas Schmitz <schmitz@lat-lon.de>
        * Added -state command line option to specify a directory where
          the workbench-state.xml file should be stored (or a file name).
        * Updated the openjump.sh script to set the -state directory to
          $HOME/.jump/.
          scripts/openjump.sh,

          and added a listener to update comboboxes when
          layers are added to the task

2007-08-21 beckerl <becker.larry@gmail.com>
        * Added right click on Layer View menu item "Select Layers with Selected Items".
          Made setSelectedLayers() public in TreeLayerNamePanel to support this function.
          Added I18n strings to all language properties files.  French, German, and Spanish
          tentative translations made.  Needs check by native speakers.

          org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.mousemenu.SelectLayersWithSelectedItemsPlugIn.java
          com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.TreeLayerNamePanel.java
          Also cleaned up some code in ZoomTool.mouseWheelMoved today
          and fixed an Exception in LayerViewPanel.MouseWheelZoomListener.

2007-08-21 Andreas Schmitz <schmitz@lat-lon.de>
        * src/org/openjump/core/ui/plugin/layer/ChangeLayerableNamePlugIn.java:
          Catched null name when clicking cancel.

2007-08-20 beckerl <becker.larry@gmail.com>
        * fixed the interned string problem with large datasets where
          every attribute value was different by adding exception handler
          that stops further interns
          org.geotools.dbffile.DbfFile.java

2007-08-17 beckerl <becker.larry@gmail.com>
        * Fixed the problem with the toolbar selection arrow tool
          losing the feature selection when right clicking.

2007-08-17 beckerl <becker.larry@gmail.com>
        * Fixed problem in Color Theming Style Panel with all cells
          displaying a fill pattern when any one was set using Custom.
          com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.ColorPanel.java

2007-08-17 beckerl <becker.larry@gmail.com>
        * added a Zoom Realtime tool to the toolbar.  This tool uses
          image stretching to simulate the zoom before it occurs for an
          accurate preview.
          org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.tools.ZoomRealtimeTool.java

          popup menu item.  It was totally nonfunctional.
          org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.layer.ToggleVisibilityPlugIn.java

2007-08-16 michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>

        * Make snap points to the grid or to vertices possible
          (note that Jon Aquino disabled this option, I'm not sure
          why he found that it could be confusing for the user)

2007-08-16 paul_d_austin <paul.austin@revolsys.com
            * Added a Segment Downhill Arrrow Style

2007-08-16 sstein <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>

                * release of OpenJUMP 1.2 D

2007-08-15 beckerl <becker.larry@gmail.com>
                * fixed a problem with the window turning black when an Image Layer
                was added due to the graphics context composite being changed.
                com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.imagery.graphic.GraphicImage.java

2007-08-15 beckerl <becker.larry@gmail.com>
                * added support for mouse wheel zooming when the zoom cursor is over
                the layer view panel. Each click of the mouse wheel zooms by 25%.
                com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.LayerViewPanel.java

2007-08-15 sstein <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>
                * set default SRID to -1
                de.hawhamburg.sridsupport.SRIDstyle.java
                org.openjump.core.ccordsys.srid.java

2007-08-15 sstein <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>

                * added windows exe for openjump (with params:
                Xmx 256, plugin-directory, properties file), hoping that it works
                also for future versions

2007-08-15 sstein <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>

                * set OpenJUMP version to OJ 1.2D in language files
                (preparation for new release witout image display problems and
                PlanarGraph bugfix by Michael and MouseWheel support by Larry)

2007-08-12 michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>

        * org.openjump.sigle.plugin.geoprocessing.oneLayer.topology.PlanarGraphPlugIn
          Fixed a bug (submitted by Hisaji Ono) where some edges had
          wrong links to faces. The method has been entirely rewritten.

        * added a warning message in language files to manage the case where
          one tries to transfer attributes from an heterogeneous layer with
          PlanarGraphPlugIn

2007-08-11 sstein <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>

        * OpenJUMP 1.2 C release

2007-08-10 michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>

        * org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.queries.QueryDialog
          org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.queries.Condition
          fixed a bug in Simple Query PlugIn (responsible of confusion between the
          three static taget options : all layers / selection / selected layers

2007-08-09 sstein <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/io/ShapefileWriter
                  added that an Exception is thrown, when layer geometries are of different type.
                  Data aren't saved then. (otherwise the user wonders when only polygons are stored)

2007-08-10 Andreas Schmitz <schmitz@lat-lon.de>

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/plugin/wms/URLWizardPanel.java,
          src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/plugin/wms/AddWMSQueryPlugIn.java:
          Changed the URL field to a editable combo box.

        * The persistent blackboard now stores a list of urls instead of just one.

2007-08-09 sstein <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>

        * removed openjump-mac.sh file since the new openjump.sh
          file works under MAC-OSX as well

        * moved batik-all.jar to lib folder (to later delete the batik folder)

2007-08-08 sstein <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>

        * src/org/openjump/OpenJumpConfiguration.java
          set EditTransaction.ROLLING_BACK_INVALID_EDITS_KEY = true when starting up
          OJUMP (i.e. invalid geometries are not alowed per default, switch can be
          done in Edit Options Panel)

2007-08-03 Andreas Schmitz <schmitz@lat-lon.de>

        * src/org/openjump/core/ui/plugin/file/SaveImageAsSVGPlugIn.java,
          src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/plugin/SaveProjectAsPlugIn.java,
          src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/GUIUtil.java:
          Tried to fix issue
          http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1246588&group_id=118054&atid=679906
          instead fixed the issue for SaveImageAsSVGPlugin and SaveProjectAsPlugin.

        * Reformatted some ChangeLog entries by me...

2007-08-03 Andreas Schmitz <schmitz@lat-lon.de>

        * src/org/openjump/OpenJumpConfiguration.java,
          src/org/openjump/core/ui/plugin/layer/ToggleVisibilityPlugIn.java,
          src/org/openjump/core/ui/plugin/layer/ChangeLayerableNamePlugIn.java,
          src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/plugin/wms/AddWMSQueryPlugIn.java:
          Added context menu entry on layer list that allows changing the layer name.
          Changed ToggleVisibilityPlugin to allow changing WMS layer visibility
          toggling.

2007-08-03 Andreas Schmitz <schmitz@lat-lon.de>

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/plugin/wms/AddWMSQueryPlugIn.java:
          The WMS field remembers the last used server address.

2007-08-01 sstein <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>

        * resolved LoadDatasetPlugIn "ok" button problem on MacOSX.
          The problem was caused by the validation method that always
          returned false. The workaround does not use validation, but
          only for MacOSX computers. To check the OS a new class was added.

2007-08-01 Andreas Schmitz <schmitz@lat-lon.de>

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/model/WMSLayer.java,
          src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/plugin/wms/EditWMSQueryPanel.java,
          src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/plugin/wms/AddWMSQueryPlugIn.java:
          WMS layers use the title now instead of the WMS layer name.
          While editing WMS requests, moving layers up/down caused the SRS
          box to switch back to the first available SRS, this was fixed.

2007-07-31 sstein <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>

        * updated from OpenJUMP 1.2 B to 1.2 C (in language files)

2007-07-31 Andreas Schmitz <schmitz@lat-lon.de>

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/plugin/wms/AddWMSQueryPlugIn.java:
          Took the liberty and updated the demo.deegree.org URL to a working
          value.

2007-07-31 Andreas Schmitz <schmitz@lat-lon.de>

        * src/de/latlon/deejump/plugin/style/LayerStyle2SLDPlugIn.java,
          src/de/latlon/deejump/plugin/style/layerstyle2sld.xsl:
          Default output is UTF-8 now instead of ISO-8859-1, fixing encoding
          problems in resulting XML files.

2007-07-30 sstein <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>

        * added fix by Malte to avoid null-pointer excpetion when making a copy of a
          FeatureCollection containing Features with null values for attributes.
          (see jpp-devel email send by sstein on 24.July.2007)

        * replaced jmat_5.0.jar by the cleaned up version jmat_5.0m.jar wich does only
          contain the org.jmat packages. Additionally the start-up scripts (.sh, .bat) have
          been updated

2007-07-13 michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>

        * Fixed a bug in LabelStyle : added trim() to avoid labels to be ex-centered

        * Fixed a bug where thick closed lines (and polygons) did not have a nice
          join_bevel on the first/last point (tip from Larry Becker)

2007-07-11 Paul Austin <paul.austin@revolsys.com>

        * Added .settings, build, target, .classpath & .project to svi:ignore to
          prevent accidental checkin of eclipse config and maven/ant generated dirs

        * Changed InfoModel to remove layers after the listeners are notified

2007-07-09 Andreas Schmitz <schmitz@lat-lon.de>

        * scripts/openjump.sh: Added improved startup script for Unix from
              Paul Austin.

2007-07-08 michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>

        * Add UnionByAttributePlugIn in the Tool/Analysis menu

        * Remove several plugins related to loading/saving files and which are
          no more useful (two plugins in the workbench.ui.plugin package and
          two other plugins in the datasource package)

        * Add automatic file extension in the main SaveDatasetAsPlugIn
          and put the format chooser at the bottom of the dialog (as in SkyJUMP)

2007-07-03 michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>

        * Simple query PlugIn : add some keys in the language property files
          in order to replace gnof, bnof, snof and nnof by an empty string in
          the user interface of Simple Query (xnof means 'no function' for data
          type x).

2007-07-02  Andreas Schmitz <schmitz@lat-lon.de>
        * src/de/latlon/deejump/plugin/style/layerstyle2sld.xsl,
          src/de/latlon/deejump/plugin/style/XSLUtility.java:
          SLD Size element is now next to the Mark element and not underneath it.
          XSLUtility is now checking for null while constructing background.

2007-06-29 michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/plugin/CloneWindowPlugIn.java
          The problem with CloneWindowPlugIn has been fixed on 2007-06-02, but
          I forgot to set back the closeable property to true. Done.

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/plugin/analysis/UnionPlugIn.java
          Fixed a bug in the Comparator used to sort geometries and
          improve union performance.

2007-06-22  s-l-teichmann <teichmann@intevation.de>

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/renderer/ThreadQueue.java:
          Replacement for the old ThreadQueue. The old ThreadQueue executes
          each and every Runnable job in a new Thread (which is expensive) and
          had a busy wait loop inside. Now worker threads are kept alive for
          at least 5 seconds waiting for new incomming jobs. This is done with
          wait()/notify().

2007-06-06  s-l-teichmann <teichmann@intevation.de>

        * ChangeLog: Moving around my generated ChangeLog locally eated my last ChangeLog entry. ;-)

2007-06-06  s-l-teichmann <teichmann@intevation.de>

        - Fixed for expensive BasicStyle construction (slowed down colour theming a lot)
        - Reorganisation of ChangeLog, Changes.txt and TODO.txt

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/renderer/style/BasicStyle.java,
          src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/style/BasicStylePanel.java:
          Applied patches to solve the problem of expensive BasicStyle object
          construction. A WKTFillPattern was created also which slows down
          construction by factor 100. Now BasicStyle are constructed without
          a fill pattern.

        * src/ChangeLog, src/Changes.txt, src/TODO.txt: removed

        * ChangeLog: readded here and fill with content from cvs2cl.pl.
          From now on maintain it manually, please! Thanks.

        * TODO.txt, Changes.txt: readded here to make them more visible
          and emphasize the fact that they are for etc/, lib/ and so on too.

2007-06-05  mentaer <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>

          closing (related to bug 1726629) : now, every internal frames
          related to a TaskFrame (table view or info frame) are closed
          before the TaskFrame (with a confirmation dialog)

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/TaskFrame.java: Fixed the
          "Closing Cloned Window" bug (1475013) : now, layer manager
          resources are released only when the last internal frame using it
          is closed.

2007-06-02  michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/WorkbenchFrame.java:
          Expose getInternalFramesAssociatedWith in WorkbenchFrame as a
          public method and use it in TaskFrame

2007-06-02  michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/ui/renderer/style/LabelStyle.java:
          Fix bug 1691834 about labelling (can label above, on are below
          lines again)

2007-06-02  michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/workbench/: JUMPWorkbench.java,
          WorkbenchProperties.java, WorkbenchPropertiesFile.java,
          plugin/PlugInManager.java: Backport Larry's bug-fix to enable

2007-06-02  michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/datastore/postgis/PostgisValueConverterFactory.java:
          Declare WKB instead of WKT for PostGIS geometry columns

          Add double-quotes around column names to be able to query
          mixed-case column names. There may be a similar bug for schema
          and table names (see bug report 1694304), but this happens
          somewhere else in the code.

2007-06-02  michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>

        * src/com/vividsolutions/jump/datastore/postgis/PostgisResultSetConverter.java:

          string, ...) the whole layer disappears, because the ColorTheming

          layer stays visible and OJ stays functional.
