    ii) maximal breaks,
    iii) Jenks optimal breaks.
    Note: The equal-number breaks calculation has been replace with one contained
 	in Classifier1D to keep consistent with API methods (however, tests show that
 	the old and the new method deliver slightly different results)
  - Integrated Jython tools from ISA / SkyJUMP.
  - Disabled plugin that allows panning with keys due to feedback with layer
    navigation to re-enable add the following line to default-plugin.xml
  - Added functions to sort categories by name and number of features

    background polygon (i.e. points are sorted out and polygon is used for clipping)
  - Added Larry's Auto-Assign-Attribute function from ISA Tools
  - Enabled the Union check box when Get Distance from Attributes is checked.
  - Added patch by Bing to parse single bytes in dbf files, which is better

    reading dbf files with multi-bytes character columns"]
  - Added error checking to prevent problems after pasting a Style
    that refers to a missing Attribute.

    Basic functionality (such as file i/o, viewing and styling) is still loaded
    from the OpenJumpConfiguration file.
  - Added new command-line parameter "-default-plugins" to load a "second"
    properties file. Plugins read from a properties file with
    "-default-plugins" will be loaded before the plugins from
    "-workbench-properties". It is intended to deliver a "default-plugins.xml"
    in the /bin/ directory of OpenJUMP. (Note: using two properties files
    enables to separate general OJ plugins from own functions)
  - Added Multi-Ring-Buffer Function for selected objects (a similar function

             that there must be an editable layer highlighted.  
  - added Replace attribute value by copy from an other attribute 
            org.openjump.sigle.plugin.replace.ReplaceValuePlugIn.java   
  - added Extract by Geometry Type on layer name context menu.         
  - added the LayerPropertiesPlugIn which adds a menu item
            "Layer Properties" to the Layer Name popup menu.  This

            of features, number of points, number of attributes, geometry type,
            DataSource class, and source path.  It works on single or multiple
            layer selections.  It also includes a transparency adjustment slider
            that works for layer selections.
  - added an option to "Write world file" in the Save Image As dialog.

          contrasting color to improve readability when using a mixed background
        * Added support for hiding text below a specified scale.  This makes it possible
          to stop text from rendering when zoomed out too far to actually read it
  - added a Zoom Realtime tool to the toolbar.  This tool uses
          image stretching to simulate the zoom before it occurs for an
          accurate preview.
                       
  Changes in the user interface:

          Supports buffering the selection. Provides a convenience union option.
          Sidebar picture  previews the current options.  It copies attributes by
          default, even from selections on multiple layers, but this can beturned off.
          Supports setting the number of segments in a quarter circle.
  - added a VertexZValue style and internationalized the VertexXYLineSegment style
  - Make snap points to the grid or to vertices possible

  - fixed File->Save View as Raster bug with the Metal L&F that caused
            the save file name text box to dissappear.  Moved the Save World File
            check box to the top of the dialog.  Also added an X edit box that
            defaults to the view's X width, but can be changed to any value up to
            3800 to save a high resolution image.  A fence icon appears to the left
            of the X box if there is a fence layer, indicating taht it will be
            used in place of the view window to define the picture bounds.        
  - improved the PastePlugin to support point coordinates in the form (1.0,1,1)

          layer name in the file chooser
  - Bug fixed in LoadDatasetPlugIn : refresh the file list each time the
          plugin is called
  - added -state command line option to specify a directory where
          the workbench-state.xml file should be stored (or a file name).
        * Updated the openjump.sh script to set the -state directory to
          $HOME/.jump/.

--------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.0 D (16.Aug.2007)

this version is equivalent to following nightly built: openjump-20070816-0019

Bugfixes and Improvements done since release of OpenJUMP 1.2 B:

- fixed a problem with the window turning black when an Image Layer was added due to the graphics context composite being changed.
- added support for mouse wheel zooming when the zoom cursor is over 
- set default SRID to -1 for PostGIS
- fixed a bug (submitted by Hisaji Ono) where some edges had
          wrong links to faces. The method has been entirely rewritten.
- added a warning message in language files to manage the case where one tries to transfer attributes from an heterogeneous layer with PlanarGraphPlugIn
- fixed a bug in Simple Query PlugIn (responsible of confusion between the
          three static taget options : all layers / selection / selected layers

- ShapefileWriter: added that an Exception is thrown, when layer geometries are of different type. 
		  Data aren't saved then. (otherwise the user wonders when only polygons are stored)
- removed openjump-mac.sh file since the new openjump.sh
          file works under MAC-OSX as well
- set EditTransaction.ROLLING_BACK_INVALID_EDITS_KEY = true when starting up
          OJUMP (i.e. invalid geometries are not alowed per default, switch can be
          done in Edit Options Panel)
- Tried to fix issue
          http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1246588&group_id=118054&atid=679906
          instead fixed the issue for SaveImageAsSVGPlugin and SaveProjectAsPlugin.
- Added context menu entry on layer list that allows changing the layer name.
          Changed ToggleVisibilityPlugin to allow changing WMS layer visibility
          toggling.
- The WMS field remembers the last used server address.
- resolved LoadDatasetPlugIn "ok" button problem on MacOSX.
          The problem was caused by the validation method that always
          returned false. The workaround does not use validation, but
          only for MacOSX computers. To check the OS a new class was added.
- WMS layers use the title now instead of the WMS layer name.
          While editing WMS requests, moving layers up/down caused the SRS
          box to switch back to the first available SRS, this was fixed.
- updated the demo.deegree.org URL to a working value.
- Default output is UTF-8 now instead of ISO-8859-1, fixing encoding
          problems in resulting XML files.
- added fix by Malte to avoid null-pointer excpetion when making a copy of a
          FeatureCollection containing Features with null values for attributes.
          (see jpp-devel email send by sstein on 24.July.2007)
- replaced jmat_5.0.jar by the cleaned up version jmat_5.0m.jar wich does only
          contain the org.jmat packages. 
- Bug fix in LabelStyle : added trim() to avoid labels to be ex-centered
- Bug fix : thick closed lines (and polygons) did not have a nice
          join_bevel on the first/last point (tip from Larry Becker)
- improvement: scripts/openjump.sh: Added improved startup script for Unix from
          Paul Austin.
- improvement: Add UnionByAttributePlugIn in the Tool/Analysis menu
- Remove several plugins related to loading/saving files and which are
          no more useful (two plugins in the workbench.ui.plugin package and
          two other plugins in the datasource package)
- improvement: Add automatic file extension in the main SaveDatasetAsPlugIn
          and put the format chooser at the bottom of the dialog (as in SkyJUMP)
- Fix a bug in the Comparator used to sort geometries and
          improve union performance.
- improvement: for expensive BasicStyle construction (slowed down colour theming a lot)
- improvement: added dissolve beanshell script by Hisaji
- Fix a problem with TaskFrame
          closing (related to bug 1726629) : now, every internal frames
          related to a TaskFrame (table view or info frame) are closed
          before the TaskFrame (with a confirmation dialog)
- Fix the "Closing Cloned Window" bug (1475013) : now, layer manager
          resources are released only when the last internal frame using it
          is closed.
- Fix bug 1691834 about labelling (can label above, on are below
          lines again)
- improvement: Backport Larry's bug-fix to enable
          workbench-properties file outside the IDE (see bug 1726102)
- Fix     Add double-quotes around column names to be able to query
          mixed-case column names. There may be a similar bug for schema
          and table names (see bug report 1694304), but this happens
          somewhere else in the code.
- improvement:
          Several optimization to be able to visualize data as wireframes
          while dragging the zoombar, even with big features and large
          dataset (use of Java2DConverter decimator, selection of large
          data instead of random data, elimination of invisible layers in
          the feature selection...)
- improvement: Including SkyJUMP's improvements concerning the rendering pipeline (point
          coordinates decimation, selection renderer)
- Fix the memory leak problem
          when removing a Layer (the LayerRender cache was not freed)
- Improvement: Cache last WMS result with a SoftReference
- Improvement: Union can now union a layer or a selection, like
          in SkyJUMP
- Improve segments extracter -> optionally removes segments
          appearing several times like the JCS equivalent plugin and
          optionally merge the result)
- fixed bug: line width textField set on the same line as the line
          width slider in the basic style panel
- fixed bug: "End feathers" decoration appeared on wrong end
- fixed bug 1713295 (Snap always on)
- update brazilian language file
- Fix BeanTools NPE : don't  load BeanTools plugin if the plugin directory is missing

Version 1.2.0 C (2007-08-11)

  This release includes

  New Features:
  - Improve Tools > Edit Geometry > Segments extracter
    Now, the plugin optionally removes segments appearing several times (as in
    the JCS equivalent plugin) and optionally merges the result
  - Improve Tools > Analysis > Union
    Now, the plugin can union a layer or a selection, as in SkyJUMP
  - Added Tools > Analysis > UnionByAttributePlugIn

  
  Changes in the user interface:
  - JoinTablePlugIn now called from tools/edit attributes menu
  - Fixed an alignment problem in the BasicStylePanel
  - Now, every internal frames related to a TaskFrame (table view or info frame)
    are closed before the TaskFrame (with a confirmation dialog)
  - Removed File > Loading Dataset From File and
                   Save Dataset As File
    added automatic file extension in the main Save Dataset As
    and put the format chooser at the bottom of the dialog (as in SkyJUMP)
  - Add WMS Query : updated the demo.deegree.org URL to a working value
  - The WMS field remembers the last used server address
  - Added context menu entry on layer list that allows changing the layer name
    Changed ToggleVisibilityPlugin to allow changing WMS layer visibility toggling
  - set EditTransaction.ROLLING_BACK_INVALID_EDITS_KEY = true when starting up
    OJUMP (i.e. invalid geometries are not alowed per default, switch can be
    done in Edit Options Panel)
  - Changed the URL field to a editable combo box (OpenJUMP now stores a list of
    urls instead of just one)
  
  Fixes and performance improvements:
  - I18N (no more exception when a string is missing)
  - Improved shapefilereader performances (memory use and loading time)
  - Fixed error with length-constraint text field in ConstraintsOptionsPanel
  - Several bug fixes with the new BeanToolsPlugIn
  - Fixed bug 1713295 (Snap always on)
  - Fixed bug 1367145 : "End feathers" decoration appeared on wrong end
  - Fixed a bug in WMSLayer.java: Cache last WMS result with a SoftReference
  - Fixed the memory leak problem when removing a Layer
  - Improved the rendering pipeline
  - Always construct WMSLayer so that they are fetched in parallel running
    threads
  - ZoomBar optimization to reduce UI latency
  - Stop throwing an exception when there are several geometry column in a
    postgis table (consider the first geometry column as the feature geometry)
  - Read PostGIS geometry columns as if it was WKB instead of WKT as it seems
    to be the standard now
  - Backport Larry's bug-fix to enable workbench-properties file outside the IDE
    (see bug 1726102)
  - Fix bug 1691834 about labelling (can label above, on are below lines again)
  - Fixed the "Closing Cloned Window" bug (1475013) : now, layer manager
    resources are released only when the last internal frame using it is closed.
  - Fixed a problem with TaskFrame closing (related to bug 1726629)
  - Fixed for expensive BasicStyle construction (slowed down colour theming a lot)
  - Replacement for the old ThreadQueue. Now worker threads are kept alive for
    at least 5 seconds waiting for new incomming jobs.
  - Fixed a bug in the optimization code of UnionPlugIn
  - SLD Size element is now next to the Mark element and not underneath it.
    XSLUtility is now checking for null while constructing background
  - Added improved startup script for Unix from Paul Austin
  - Changed InfoModel to remove layers after the listeners are notified
  - Fixed a bug in LabelStyle : added trim() to avoid labels to be ex-centered
  - Fixed a bug where thick closed lines (and polygons) did not have a nice
    join_bevel on the first/last point
  - Replaced jmat_5.0.jar by the cleaned up version jmat_5.0m.jar
  - Bug fixed thanks to Malte, to avoid null-pointer excpetion when making a copy
    of a FeatureCollection containing Features with null values for attributes.
    (see jpp-devel email send by sstein on 24.July.2007)
  - SLD PlugIn : Default output is UTF-8 now instead of ISO-8859-1, fixing
    encoding problems in resulting XML files
  - WMS Layers use the title now instead of the WMS layer name.
    While editing WMS requests, moving layers up/down caused the SRS
    box to switch back to the first available SRS, this was fixed
  - resolved LoadDatasetPlugIn "ok" button problem on MacOSX
  - ShapefileWriter : an Exception is thrown if one try to save a shapefile with
    mixed geometries (otherwise the user wonders when only polygons are stored)
  - fixed a bug in Simple Query (responsible of confusion between the
    three static taget options : all layers / selection / selected layers

  Many new translations
  
  Code clean up (fixed javadoc tags, removed duplicated imports, unused files)
