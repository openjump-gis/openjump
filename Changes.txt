--------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3.1 (released on 6.December.2009)

  This release includes
  
  The OpenJUMP version 1.3.1 is primarily a maintenance release to solve a
  problem with the tiff image file export. So there are is only one new feature
  for working with PostGIS queries, compared to version 1.3. 

--------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3.0 (released on 19.April.2009)

  This release includes
  
  New Features:
  
  - new (cartographic) attribute classification methods for color theming added
 	to equal number and quantiles:
 	i) mean-standard deviation,
 	ii) maximal breaks,
 	iii) Jenks optimal
  - new function that generates a layer attribute statistics table (integrated from PirolJUMP)
  - Jython/Python support as second scripting possibility besides BeanShell (integrated from SkyJUMP)
  - new raster image reader that allows to directly use Sextante raster/image analysis tools (integrated from PirolJUMP)
  - the list of functions available in the "tools" menu is now configurable with the file "default-plugins.xml"
  - new function that allows searching in all attribute values over all layers
  - new function to simplify polygon within a tesselation/landscape of polygons
  - new tool that allows to add notes in the Editing toolbox
  - new Auto-Complete-Polygon tool
  - new synchronization function for map views for panning and zooming operations
  - ...for more new functions see below... 
  
  Fixes and performance improvements:
  
  - New attribute classification methods work now with integer attributes too.
  - WMS Encoding layer names and format properly.

    i.e. what source and what target layer is.
  - Fixed issue (bugreport) 1779771 - removed confusing scale units / label.
  - Fixed bug 2673544 - made Cut Polygon Tool undo-able.
  - Fixed bugs 2628678 and 2514296 - Auto Complete Polygons is now
    undo-able and adds polygons only to an editable layer (i.e. the
    tool choses the next editable layer for drawing or creates a new layer).
  - Fixed bug 2660257 - enabled reading of LinearRing geometries from JML files.
  - Added layer context menu functions for Pirol/Sextante raster images.
  - Created new "statistics" menu in tools. Moved feature-, layer-,
    and attribute statistics functions into the menu.
  - Newly created layers are marked with featureCollectionModified=true.
    So when OpenJUMP is closed, it should ask for saving the data.
  - Integrated RasterImageLayer from Pirol - this will allow to
   	use Sextante with OpenJUMP directly (when Sextante bindings are changed too).
  - Integrated Layer Statistics tool from Pirol.
    To be found in /Tools/Analysis/One Layer/Attribute Statistic Overview
  - Added further 1-D Classification methods for ColorTheming.
    Besides using the equal-interval and equal-number methods,
    class breaks can now be calculated using
    i) Mean-Standard Deviation,
    ii) maximal breaks,
    iii) Jenks optimal breaks.
    Note: The equal-number breaks calculation has been replace with one contained
 	in Classifier1D to keep consistent with API methods (however, tests show that
 	the old and the new method deliver slightly different results)
  - Integrated Jython tools from ISA / SkyJUMP.
  - Disabled plugin that allows panning with keys due to feedback with layer
    navigation to re-enable add the following line to default-plugin.xml
  - Added functions to sort categories by name and number of features

    a gis.
  - Added function to simplify polygons if they are part of a tesselation in
    Tools/Generalization.

    geometry types
  - Added Larry's Clip-To-Fence function from ISA Tools
  - Extended Thiessen polygon creation to be aware of a delineating
    background polygon (i.e. points are sorted out and polygon is used for clipping)
  - Added Larry's Auto-Assign-Attribute function from ISA Tools
  - Enabled the Union check box when Get Distance from Attributes is checked.
  - Added patch by Bing to parse single bytes in dbf files, which is better
    for chinese characters [see email topic on googlegroups: "patchs for
    reading dbf files with multi-bytes character columns"]
  - Added error checking to prevent problems after pasting a Style
    that refers to a missing Attribute.
  - Updated snapping policy to allow snapping to lines of multi polygons
    (and geometry collections in general).
  - Changed BufferPlugIn to take advantage of new UnaryUnionOp.union()
    method of JTS 1.9.
  - Fixed null pointer when reading from project file.
  - Set the default button for Enter key to the OK.
  - Replace old progressiveUnion optimization by the new UnaryUnionOp of
    JTS 1.9 which is much faster

    Basic functionality (such as file i/o, viewing and styling) is still loaded
    from the OpenJumpConfiguration file.
  - Added new command-line parameter "-default-plugins" to load a "second"
    properties file. Plugins read from a properties file with
    "-default-plugins" will be loaded before the plugins from
    "-workbench-properties". It is intended to deliver a "default-plugins.xml"
    in the /bin/ directory of OpenJUMP. (Note: using two properties files
    enables to separate general OJ plugins from own functions)
  - Added Multi-Ring-Buffer Function for selected objects (a similar function
    can be found in ArcGIS:
    http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=multiple_ring_buffer_(analysis) )

    which can be entered as 'http://user:password@server/path'
  - Added new function to intersect two layers that contain
    polygons under /Tools/Two Layers/. The function allows in
    a second step to transfer the attributes from both
    source layers.
  - Enabled loading of Mr.SID layers using the new OpenFramework
    (note: problems exist with deleting the temp-jpg-files in
    MrSIDReferencedImage.paint)
  - Fixed parsing of WMS capabilities without GetFeatureInfo section.
  - Added wms-default url to http://openaerialmap.org/wms/, bug [1944641]

  - Added ImportSLD plugin. 
  - added SLD-Export of SVG images.
  - added a Paste Items At Point menu item on the layer view context
             menu that pastes the clipboard at the right-clicked point.  Note 
             that there must be an editable layer highlighted.  
  - added Replace attribute value by copy from an other attribute 
            org.openjump.sigle.plugin.replace.ReplaceValuePlugIn.java   
  - added Extract by Geometry Type on layer name context menu.         
  - added the LayerPropertiesPlugIn which adds a menu item
            "Layer Properties" to the Layer Name popup menu.  This
            feature will display layer information such as name, number
            of features, number of points, number of attributes, geometry type,
            DataSource class, and source path.  It works on single or multiple
            layer selections.  It also includes a transparency adjustment slider
            that works for layer selections.
  - added an option to "Write world file" in the Save Image As dialog.
		  I18N strings were added but need translation.
		  com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.plugin.SaveImageAsPlugIn.java

          contrasting color to improve readability when using a mixed background
        * Added support for hiding text below a specified scale.  This makes it possible
          to stop text from rendering when zoomed out too far to actually read it
  - added a Zoom Realtime tool to the toolbar.  This tool uses
          image stretching to simulate the zoom before it occurs for an
          accurate preview.
                       
  Changes in the user interface:
  
  - replaced "Transfer Attributes" from SIGLE with Spatial Join from JUMP
  - renamed CutPolygonPlugIn to SplitPolygonPlugIn 
  - added capability to use external graphics as fill patterns.

  - improved Tools->Generate->Buffer.
          Supports buffering the selection. Provides a convenience union option.
          Sidebar picture  previews the current options.  It copies attributes by
          default, even from selections on multiple layers, but this can beturned off.
          Supports setting the number of segments in a quarter circle.
  - added a VertexZValue style and internationalized the VertexXYLineSegment style
  - Make snap points to the grid or to vertices possible
  - Added a Segment Downhill Arrrow Style

       enables offline working with local WMSs.
  - fixed File->Save View as Raster bug with the Metal L&F that caused
            the save file name text box to dissappear.  Moved the Save World File
            check box to the top of the dialog.  Also added an X edit box that
            defaults to the view's X width, but can be changed to any value up to
            3800 to save a high resolution image.  A fence icon appears to the left
            of the X box if there is a fence layer, indicating taht it will be
            used in place of the view window to define the picture bounds.        
  - improved the PastePlugin to support point coordinates in the form (1.0,1,1)
       or (1 1 1) with any amount of white space. Multiple points can be pasted

  - Bug fixed in SaveDatasetAsPlugIn [bug 1770783]: now display the
          layer name in the file chooser
  - Bug fixed in LoadDatasetPlugIn : refresh the file list each time the
          plugin is called
  - added -state command line option to specify a directory where
          the workbench-state.xml file should be stored (or a file name).
        * Updated the openjump.sh script to set the -state directory to
          $HOME/.jump/.
  - improvements to Simple Query: Put resulting layer in standard Result category,
          and added a listener to update comboboxes when
          layers are added to the task

--------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.0 D (16.Aug.2007)

this version is equivalent to following nightly built: openjump-20070816-0019

Bugfixes and Improvements done since release of OpenJUMP 1.2 B:

- fixed a problem with the window turning black when an Image Layer was added due to the graphics context composite being changed.
- added support for mouse wheel zooming when the zoom cursor is over 
- set default SRID to -1 for PostGIS
- fixed a bug (submitted by Hisaji Ono) where some edges had
          wrong links to faces. The method has been entirely rewritten.
- added a warning message in language files to manage the case where one tries to transfer attributes from an heterogeneous layer with PlanarGraphPlugIn
- fixed a bug in Simple Query PlugIn (responsible of confusion between the
          three static taget options : all layers / selection / selected layers

- ShapefileWriter: added that an Exception is thrown, when layer geometries are of different type. 
		  Data aren't saved then. (otherwise the user wonders when only polygons are stored)
- removed openjump-mac.sh file since the new openjump.sh
          file works under MAC-OSX as well
- set EditTransaction.ROLLING_BACK_INVALID_EDITS_KEY = true when starting up
          OJUMP (i.e. invalid geometries are not alowed per default, switch can be
          done in Edit Options Panel)
- Tried to fix issue
          http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1246588&group_id=118054&atid=679906
          instead fixed the issue for SaveImageAsSVGPlugin and SaveProjectAsPlugin.
- Added context menu entry on layer list that allows changing the layer name.
          Changed ToggleVisibilityPlugin to allow changing WMS layer visibility
          toggling.
- The WMS field remembers the last used server address.
- resolved LoadDatasetPlugIn "ok" button problem on MacOSX.
          The problem was caused by the validation method that always
          returned false. The workaround does not use validation, but
          only for MacOSX computers. To check the OS a new class was added.
- WMS layers use the title now instead of the WMS layer name.
          While editing WMS requests, moving layers up/down caused the SRS
          box to switch back to the first available SRS, this was fixed.
- updated the demo.deegree.org URL to a working value.
- Default output is UTF-8 now instead of ISO-8859-1, fixing encoding
          problems in resulting XML files.
- added fix by Malte to avoid null-pointer excpetion when making a copy of a
          FeatureCollection containing Features with null values for attributes.
          (see jpp-devel email send by sstein on 24.July.2007)
- replaced jmat_5.0.jar by the cleaned up version jmat_5.0m.jar wich does only
          contain the org.jmat packages. 
- Bug fix in LabelStyle : added trim() to avoid labels to be ex-centered
- Bug fix : thick closed lines (and polygons) did not have a nice
          join_bevel on the first/last point (tip from Larry Becker)
- improvement: scripts/openjump.sh: Added improved startup script for Unix from
          Paul Austin.
- improvement: Add UnionByAttributePlugIn in the Tool/Analysis menu
- Remove several plugins related to loading/saving files and which are
          no more useful (two plugins in the workbench.ui.plugin package and
          two other plugins in the datasource package)
- improvement: Add automatic file extension in the main SaveDatasetAsPlugIn
          and put the format chooser at the bottom of the dialog (as in SkyJUMP)
- Fix a bug in the Comparator used to sort geometries and
          improve union performance.
- improvement: for expensive BasicStyle construction (slowed down colour theming a lot)
- improvement: added dissolve beanshell script by Hisaji
- Fix a problem with TaskFrame
          closing (related to bug 1726629) : now, every internal frames
          related to a TaskFrame (table view or info frame) are closed
          before the TaskFrame (with a confirmation dialog)
- Fix the "Closing Cloned Window" bug (1475013) : now, layer manager
          resources are released only when the last internal frame using it
          is closed.
- Fix bug 1691834 about labelling (can label above, on are below
          lines again)
- improvement: Backport Larry's bug-fix to enable
          workbench-properties file outside the IDE (see bug 1726102)
- Fix     Add double-quotes around column names to be able to query
          mixed-case column names. There may be a similar bug for schema
          and table names (see bug report 1694304), but this happens
          somewhere else in the code.
- improvement:
          Several optimization to be able to visualize data as wireframes
          while dragging the zoombar, even with big features and large
          dataset (use of Java2DConverter decimator, selection of large
          data instead of random data, elimination of invisible layers in
          the feature selection...)
- improvement: Including SkyJUMP's improvements concerning the rendering pipeline (point
          coordinates decimation, selection renderer)
- Fix the memory leak problem
          when removing a Layer (the LayerRender cache was not freed)
- Improvement: Cache last WMS result with a SoftReference
- Improvement: Union can now union a layer or a selection, like
          in SkyJUMP
- Improve segments extracter -> optionally removes segments
          appearing several times like the JCS equivalent plugin and
          optionally merge the result)

  - Fixed a bug where thick closed lines (and polygons) did not have a nice
    join_bevel on the first/last point
  - Replaced jmat_5.0.jar by the cleaned up version jmat_5.0m.jar
  - Bug fixed thanks to Malte, to avoid null-pointer excpetion when making a copy
    of a FeatureCollection containing Features with null values for attributes.
    (see jpp-devel email send by sstein on 24.July.2007)
  - SLD PlugIn : Default output is UTF-8 now instead of ISO-8859-1, fixing
    encoding problems in resulting XML files
  - WMS Layers use the title now instead of the WMS layer name.
    While editing WMS requests, moving layers up/down caused the SRS
    box to switch back to the first available SRS, this was fixed
  - resolved LoadDatasetPlugIn "ok" button problem on MacOSX
  - ShapefileWriter : an Exception is thrown if one try to save a shapefile with
    mixed geometries (otherwise the user wonders when only polygons are stored)
  - fixed a bug in Simple Query (responsible of confusion between the
    three static taget options : all layers / selection / selected layers

  Many new translations
  
  Code clean up (fixed javadoc tags, removed duplicated imports, unused files)
