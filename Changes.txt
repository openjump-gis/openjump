Version ${version.number} ${version.release} rev.${version.revision} (released on ${version.buildDateLong})

New Features
  * replace Quasimode Shortcut Alt+Shift with Shift to Pan
   (alt+shift is used by windows to change the default language)
  * Complete rewrite of MergePolygonsWithNeighbourPlugIn

Improvements
  * re-include batik libs in CORE, needed in "Change Style"
  * Upgraded Raster Tools Extension to v2.05 (#88)
   - implement Spatial reference System into TIFF file export, allows to 
     reproject raster and image files between different coordinate reference 
     systems.
   - Delaunay triangulation plugin: added a set of methods in order to cover 
     a wide set of vector to raster transformation (Nearest Neighbor, Inverse 
     Distance Weighted, Min Z, Max Z and Mean Z).
   - Info and Style plugin are grouped together as one plugin.
   - Removed embedded JEP classes: Raster Calculator plugin of Raster Tools
     now uses external JEP library (OpenJUMP PLUS)  and it is deactivated 
     if JEP is missing (OpenJUMP CORE).
  * Spatially consistency between 2  Raster layers
   Check if the RasteImageLayer is spatially consistent with another:
   a) both have the same cell size
   b) both have the same dimension (same width and height)
   c) both overlap to each other into the geographic space
   Useful for overlapping processes between two raster image layers
  * upgrade topology extension to 2.0.5 (speed improvement)
  * Deactivated the numeric limit in raster/layer info (#90)
  * convert Attributes of type OBJECT to string when writing shapefiles

Bug Fixes (tickets on either
  https://sourceforge.net/p/jump-pilot/bugs/ or
  https://github.com/openjump-gis/openjump/issues )
  * fix unintended exception in PlumePlugin
  * fix geometry function dialog box (use selected features option was broken)
  * survive invalid (probably PLUS) styles when opening projects with CORE

  New Features
  * Add on Layer menu "Export layer envelope as geometry" which 
    exports the envelope of any type of layer supported by OpenJUMP
    (Layer.class, ReferencedImageStyle.class, WMSLayer.class, WFSLayer.class,
    RasterImageLayer.class) as geometry. Layer name, layer datasource (if any)
    and CRS (only for WMS and WFS) are saved as layer attributes
  * Add a "Style" plugin to WMS Layer dialog. 
    Currently only Visibility by scale is available
  * Substituted ExportEnvelopeAsGeometryPlugIn Raster plugIn with
    more general ExportLayerableEnvelopeAsGeometryPlugIn
  * RASTER: Add Layer Statistics Plugin (on submenu "Statistics")
  * Drivers for esri ASCII and Floating Point grids: added capability to write
    asc and flt files. Some bugs fixed.
  * RasterImageLayerProperties.class. Upgraded display as HTML instead of TXT
    (used HTMLPanel.class), Info can be saved as HTML file
  * Added very first version of Oracle Spatial Support in Data Store Layer 
    Wizard, based on Geotools gt2-oracle-spatial.jar to load geometry from 
    ORA structure efficiently.
    Current features: 
       - Lists geometry tables grouped by schemas (user connection schema is 
         considered as the default schema)
       - Loads Oracle geometry tables storing POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON and
         MULTI*. Does not manage other Oracle spatial types (topology, raster
         etc.)
       - Handles several geometry columns (other geometric columns are 
         converted to WKT)
       - Efficient data loading based on Larry Reader DB Plugin code
  * Replaced DataStore Combobox displaying each layer in a DataStore by a 
    TreeTable based on Netbeans Swing Outline component. Multiple layers can 
    be selected in the tree.
    Layers are grouped by schemas in the tree.
    Limit, Where Clause and Caching properties can be edited in the table
  * Extended inspection to multiband raster layers.
    - Multiple measure are now displayed (and saved) by default.
      Press SHIFT to cancel previous and display only last measure.
    - Moving cursor on image shows raster cell value on lower panel
  * Add new Compare Raster Grid layers to Raster plugins
  * Add 2 new plugin to manage nodata values on monoband DEM
    - Change No Data Value: it changes default nodata value of file
    - Set input value to no dta;: it changes an arbitrary cell value to
      default nodata
  * FR 215 : don't open a new ViewAttributesFrame if there is already one
    open for the selected layer Layer
  * Manage new attribute types BOOLEAN and LONG in jml and shp drivers
    (also manage other datatypes so that they can be written as one
    of the well-known datatype instead of throwing an error message)
  * Hide unused AttributeType from the schema.
    Add a way to nullify attribute values in the Attribute panel :
    - String and boolean : press left button, and click on null menu item
    before releasing
    - Date and numerics : just empty the field
  * Added ChangeRangeValuesToNoDataPlugIn.
    This plugin allows to change a range of cell values (of a Sextante single
    band raster layer) to nodata value. An option allowas to extract only the
    input range of value (and set the other values to nodata)
  * Layer tree tooltip is now configurable via "Configure tooltip"
    in Option panel - 2 options :
    - original minimal JUMP/OpenJUMP tooltip
    - advanced info tooltip
    Use different colors (red and blue) to display layers with no datasource 
    and modified layers with datasource in the tooltips
  * FR #220 : add an option to snap on feature being edited. Indeed, the new
    snap policy is applied on LineString edition only as snapping on a polygon
    being edited tends to create invalid polygons
  * Raster Color Editor Panel. Added an option to invert color range and an 
    option to set values outside choosen range to transparent. Optimized color
    ramp. Added more color ramps
  * FR 218 : implement new attribute types in RandomTrianglesPlugIn
  * new select tool to select one or several overlapping features
  * Add WMS Legend plugin to WMS layer context menu

    Other tools submenu
  * Add 4 morphologic indices to GeometryAttributes plugin :
    - polygon width
    - polygon length
    - circularity (Miller)
    - compacity (Gravélius)
  * Added "Change Style" plugin to WMS Layers - currently only general 
    transparency and scale visibility are available
  * Added CutFeatures tool into the editing toolbox
   - This tool partially derives from SplitPolygonPlugIn.class from Kosmo SAIG
   - modified to be used both with selected Linestrings and Polygons
  * add new plugin EraseLayerAWithLayerB in Tools>Analysis
  * add MakeValidPlugIn in Tools>Analysis to repair invalid geometries
  * Spatial Databases support enhanced: support for Oracle Spatial, 
    MySQL/MariaDB, Spatialite added.
    - FilterQuery and Adhoc queries supported for these databases
    - Error detection in case of bad WHERE clause detected when loading a layer
     (layer removed from Panel)
    - New connection icons according to database type
    - Oracle Spatial: reads SDO_GEOMETRY with geotools code, reflection used 
      on com.oracle.* methods to avoid jar dependence (ede code)
    - MariaDB: supports WKB and natives binary types,
      thanks to code from Larry Reeder
    - Spatialite: supports Spatialite binary type, WKB and WKT.
      supports several geometry_column metadata table layout (code from 
      Larry Reeder DB Plugin)
  * Add support to H2GIS spatial database
      of licensing restrictions
  * add explicit mysql datastore for mysql jdbc

    ArcGIS "eliminate"), and intersect all polygons within a layer
  - OpenJUMP now remembers the window location, size, and maximized state in the
    workbench-state.xml file and the project files
  - better handling of null attributes and date attributes in queries

--------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3.1 (released on 6.December.2009)

  This release includes
  
  The OpenJUMP version 1.3.1 is primarily a maintenance release to solve a
  problem with the tiff image file export. So there are is only one new feature
  for working with PostGIS queries, compared to version 1.3. 

--------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3.0 (released on 19.April.2009)

  This release includes
  
  New Features:
  
  - new (cartographic) attribute classification methods for color theming added
   to equal number and quantiles:
   i) mean-standard deviation,
   ii) maximal breaks,
   iii) Jenks optimal
  - new function that generates a layer attribute statistics table
    (integrated from PirolJUMP)
  - Jython/Python support as second scripting possibility besides BeanShell
    (integrated from SkyJUMP)
  - new raster image reader that allows to directly use Sextante raster/image
    analysis tools (integrated from PirolJUMP)
  - the list of functions available in the "tools" menu is now configurable
    with the file "default-plugins.xml"
  - new function that allows searching in all attribute values over all layers
  - new function to simplify polygon within a tesselation/landscape of polygons
  - new tool that allows to add notes in the Editing toolbox
  - new Auto-Complete-Polygon tool
  - new synchronization function for map views for panning and zooming
    operations
  - ...for more new functions see below... 
  
  Fixes and performance improvements:
  
  - New attribute classification methods work now with integer attributes too.
  - WMS Encoding layer names and format properly.
  - Add, remove and fix three small scripts in the BeanTools script directory
  - Fixed issue/feature request 1938020 - selections generated with
    the spatial query function can now be deleted
  - Fixed issue (bugreport) 1786353 - improved Layer description for A/B,
    i.e. what source and what target layer is.
  - Fixed issue (bugreport) 1779771 - removed confusing scale units / label.
  - Fixed bug 2673544 - made Cut Polygon Tool undo-able.
  - Fixed bugs 2628678 and 2514296 - Auto Complete Polygons is now
    undo-able and adds polygons only to an editable layer (i.e. the
    tool choses the next editable layer for drawing or creates a new layer).
  - Fixed bug 2660257 - enabled reading of LinearRing geometries from JML files.
  - Added layer context menu functions for Pirol/Sextante raster images.
  - Created new "statistics" menu in tools. Moved feature-, layer-,
    and attribute statistics functions into the menu.
  - Newly created layers are marked with featureCollectionModified=true.
    So when OpenJUMP is closed, it should ask for saving the data.
  - Integrated RasterImageLayer from Pirol - this will allow to
     use Sextante with OpenJUMP directly (when Sextante bindings are changed too).
  - Integrated Layer Statistics tool from Pirol.
    To be found in /Tools/Analysis/One Layer/Attribute Statistic Overview
  - Added further 1-D Classification methods for ColorTheming.
    Besides using the equal-interval and equal-number methods,
    class breaks can now be calculated using
    i) Mean-Standard Deviation,
    ii) maximal breaks,
    iii) Jenks optimal breaks.
    Note: The equal-number breaks calculation has been replace with one
    contained in Classifier1D to keep consistent with API methods (however,
    tests show that the old and the new method deliver slightly different 
    results)
  - Integrated Jython tools from ISA / SkyJUMP.
  - Disabled plugin that allows panning with keys due to feedback with layer
    navigation to re-enable add the following line to default-plugin.xml
  - Added functions to sort categories by name and number of features

  - Added function to delete features from a layer that have the same geometry.
  - Fixed bug 1821235 : with respect to loading *.ECW images
  - New Function: Search All Attributes aims to add search engine capability to
    a gis.
  - Added function to simplify polygons if they are part of a tesselation in
    Tools/Generalization.
  - Added function to extract boundaries of polygons in 
    Tools/Edit Geometry/Convert/.
    This function can be used to simplify the boundaries and then to recreate
    simplified polygons.
  - Internationalization for Extract Point plugin.
  - Removal of ISA simplification plugin (made init as comment in 
    default-plugins.xml).
  - Modified findMaxStringLength in Shape File Writer to not allow zero length

    geometry types
  - Added Larry's Clip-To-Fence function from ISA Tools
  - Extended Thiessen polygon creation to be aware of a delineating
    background polygon (i.e. points are sorted out and polygon is used for
    clipping)
  - Added Larry's Auto-Assign-Attribute function from ISA Tools
  - Enabled the Union check box when Get Distance from Attributes is checked.
  - Added patch by Bing to parse single bytes in dbf files, which is better
    for chinese characters [see email topic on googlegroups: "patchs for
    reading dbf files with multi-bytes character columns"]
  - Added error checking to prevent problems after pasting a Style
    that refers to a missing Attribute.
  - Updated snapping policy to allow snapping to lines of multi polygons
    (and geometry collections in general).
  - Changed BufferPlugIn to take advantage of new UnaryUnionOp.union()
    method of JTS 1.9.
  - Fixed null pointer when reading from project file.
  - Set the default button for Enter key to the OK.
  - Replace old progressiveUnion optimization by the new UnaryUnionOp of

    Basic functionality (such as file i/o, viewing and styling) is still loaded
    from the OpenJumpConfiguration file.
  - Added new command-line parameter "-default-plugins" to load a "second"
    properties file. Plugins read from a properties file with
    "-default-plugins" will be loaded before the plugins from
    "-workbench-properties". It is intended to deliver a "default-plugins.xml"
    in the /bin/ directory of OpenJUMP. (Note: using two properties files
    enables to separate general OJ plugins from own functions)
  - Added Multi-Ring-Buffer Function for selected objects (a similar function
    can be found in ArcGIS:
    http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/
    9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=multiple_ring_buffer_(analysis) )

    with basic HTTP authentication. Credentials are taken from URL,
    which can be entered as 'http://user:password@server/path'
  - Added new function to intersect two layers that contain
    polygons under /Tools/Two Layers/. The function allows in
    a second step to transfer the attributes from both
    source layers.
  - Enabled loading of Mr.SID layers using the new OpenFramework
    (note: problems exist with deleting the temp-jpg-files in
    MrSIDReferencedImage.paint)
  - Fixed parsing of WMS capabilities without GetFeatureInfo section.
  - Added wms-default url to http://openaerialmap.org/wms/, bug [1944641]

  - Added ImportSLD plugin. 
  - added SLD-Export of SVG images.
  - added a Paste Items At Point menu item on the layer view context
             menu that pastes the clipboard at the right-clicked point.  Note 
             that there must be an editable layer highlighted.  
  - added Replace attribute value by copy from an other attribute 
            org.openjump.sigle.plugin.replace.ReplaceValuePlugIn.java   
  - added Extract by Geometry Type on layer name context menu.         
  - added the LayerPropertiesPlugIn which adds a menu item
            "Layer Properties" to the Layer Name popup menu.  This
            feature will display layer information such as name, number
            of features, number of points, number of attributes, geometry type,
            DataSource class, and source path.  It works on single or multiple
            layer selections.  It also includes a transparency adjustment slider
            that works for layer selections.
  - added an option to "Write world file" in the Save Image As dialog.
      I18N strings were added but need translation.
      com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.plugin.SaveImageAsPlugIn.java
      org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.file.WorldFileWriter.java

          contrasting color to improve readability when using a mixed background
        * Added support for hiding text below a specified scale.
          This makes it possible to stop text from rendering when zoomed out
          too far to actually read it
  - added a Zoom Realtime tool to the toolbar.  This tool uses
          image stretching to simulate the zoom before it occurs for an
          accurate preview.
                       
  Changes in the user interface:
  
  - replaced "Transfer Attributes" from SIGLE with Spatial Join from JUMP
  - renamed CutPolygonPlugIn to SplitPolygonPlugIn

          Supports buffering the selection. Provides a convenience union option.
          Sidebar picture  previews the current options.
          It copies attributes by default, even from selections on multiple
          layers, but this can beturned off.
          Supports setting the number of segments in a quarter circle.
  - added a VertexZValue style and 
    internationalized the VertexXYLineSegment style
  - Make snap points to the grid or to vertices possible
  - Added a Segment Downhill Arrrow Style

       enables offline working with local WMSs.
  - fixed File->Save View as Raster bug with the Metal L&F that caused
    the save file name text box to dissappear.
      Moved the Save World File check box to the top of the dialog.
      Also added an X edit box that defaults to the view's X width,
      but can be changed to any value up to 3800 to save a high resolution
      image.  A fence icon appears to the left of the X box if there is a fence
      layer, indicating that it will be used in place of the view window to
      define the picture bounds.
  - improved the PastePlugin to support point coordinates in the form (1.0,1,1)
       or (1 1 1) with any amount of white space. Multiple points can be pasted

          layer name in the file chooser
  - Bug fixed in LoadDatasetPlugIn : refresh the file list each time the
          plugin is called
  - added -state command line option to specify a directory where
          the workbench-state.xml file should be stored (or a file name).
        * Updated the openjump.sh script to set the -state directory to
          $HOME/.jump/.
  - improvements to Simple Query: Put resulting layer in standard
    Result category, and added a listener to update comboboxes when
    layers are added to the task
  - added right click on Layer View menu item 
    "Select Layers with Selected Items".
    Made setSelectedLayers() public in TreeLayerNamePanel to support

--------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.0 D (16.Aug.2007)

this version is equivalent to following nightly built: openjump-20070816-0019

Bugfixes and Improvements done since release of OpenJUMP 1.2 B:

- fixed a problem with the window turning black when an Image Layer was added
  due to the graphics context composite being changed.
- added support for mouse wheel zooming when the zoom cursor is over 
- set default SRID to -1 for PostGIS
- fixed a bug (submitted by Hisaji Ono) where some edges had
          wrong links to faces. The method has been entirely rewritten.
- added a warning message in language files to manage the case where one
  tries to transfer attributes from an heterogeneous layer with
  PlanarGraphPlugIn
- fixed a bug in Simple Query PlugIn (responsible of confusion between the
  three static taget options : all layers / selection / selected layers
- ShapefileWriter: added that an Exception is thrown, when layer geometries
  are of different type. 
  Data aren't saved then. (otherwise the user wonders when only polygons
  are stored)
- removed openjump-mac.sh file since the new openjump.sh
  file works under MAC-OSX as well
- set EditTransaction.ROLLING_BACK_INVALID_EDITS_KEY = true when starting up
  OJUMP (i.e. invalid geometries are not alowed per default, switch
  can be done in Edit Options Panel)
- Tried to fix issue
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/
    index.php?func=detail&aid=1246588&group_id=118054&atid=679906
  instead fixed the issue for SaveImageAsSVGPlugin and SaveProjectAsPlugin.
- Added context menu entry on layer list that allows changing the layer name.
  Changed ToggleVisibilityPlugin to allow changing WMS layer visibility
  toggling.
- The WMS field remembers the last used server address.
- resolved LoadDatasetPlugIn "ok" button problem on MacOSX.
  The problem was caused by the validation method that always
  returned false. The workaround does not use validation, but
  only for MacOSX computers. To check the OS a new class was added.
- WMS layers use the title now instead of the WMS layer name.
  While editing WMS requests, moving layers up/down caused the SRS
  box to switch back to the first available SRS, this was fixed.
- updated the demo.deegree.org URL to a working value.
- Default output is UTF-8 now instead of ISO-8859-1, fixing encoding
          problems in resulting XML files.
- added fix by Malte to avoid null-pointer excpetion when making a copy of a
          FeatureCollection containing Features with null values for attributes.
          (see jpp-devel email send by sstein on 24.July.2007)
- replaced jmat_5.0.jar by the cleaned up version jmat_5.0m.jar wich does only
          contain the org.jmat packages. 
- Bug fix in LabelStyle : added trim() to avoid labels to be ex-centered
- Bug fix : thick closed lines (and polygons) did not have a nice
          join_bevel on the first/last point (tip from Larry Becker)
- improvement: scripts/openjump.sh: Added improved startup script for Unix from
          Paul Austin.
- improvement: Add UnionByAttributePlugIn in the Tool/Analysis menu
- Remove several plugins related to loading/saving files and which are
          no more useful (two plugins in the workbench.ui.plugin package and
          two other plugins in the datasource package)
- improvement: Add automatic file extension in the main SaveDatasetAsPlugIn
          and put the format chooser at the bottom of the dialog (as in SkyJUMP)
- Fix a bug in the Comparator used to sort geometries and
          improve union performance.
- improvement: for expensive BasicStyle construction 
  (slowed down colour theming a lot)
- improvement: added dissolve beanshell script by Hisaji
- Fix a problem with TaskFrame
          closing (related to bug 1726629) : now, every internal frames
          related to a TaskFrame (table view or info frame) are closed
          before the TaskFrame (with a confirmation dialog)
- Fix the "Closing Cloned Window" bug (1475013) : now, layer manager
          resources are released only when the last internal frame using it
          is closed.
- Fix bug 1691834 about labelling (can label above, on are below
          lines again)
- improvement: Backport Larry's bug-fix to enable
          workbench-properties file outside the IDE (see bug 1726102)
- Fix     Add double-quotes around column names to be able to query
          mixed-case column names. There may be a similar bug for schema
          and table names (see bug report 1694304), but this happens
          somewhere else in the code.
- improvement:
          Several optimization to be able to visualize data as wireframes
          while dragging the zoombar, even with big features and large
          dataset (use of Java2DConverter decimator, selection of large
          data instead of random data, elimination of invisible layers in
          the feature selection...)
- improvement: Including SkyJUMP's improvements concerning
  the rendering pipeline (point coordinates decimation, selection renderer)
- Fix the memory leak problem
          when removing a Layer (the LayerRender cache was not freed)
- Improvement: Cache last WMS result with a SoftReference
- Improvement: Union can now union a layer or a selection, like
          in SkyJUMP
- Improve segments extracter -> optionally removes segments
          appearing several times like the JCS equivalent plugin and
          optionally merge the result)
- fixed bug: line width textField set on the same line as the line
          width slider in the basic style panel
- fixed bug: "End feathers" decoration appeared on wrong end
- fixed bug 1713295 (Snap always on)

  - Replaced jmat_5.0.jar by the cleaned up version jmat_5.0m.jar
  - Bug fixed thanks to Malte, to avoid null-pointer excpetion when making a copy
    of a FeatureCollection containing Features with null values for attributes.
    (see jpp-devel email send by sstein on 24.July.2007)
  - SLD PlugIn : Default output is UTF-8 now instead of ISO-8859-1, fixing
    encoding problems in resulting XML files
  - WMS Layers use the title now instead of the WMS layer name.
    While editing WMS requests, moving layers up/down caused the SRS
    box to switch back to the first available SRS, this was fixed
  - resolved LoadDatasetPlugIn "ok" button problem on MacOSX
  - ShapefileWriter : an Exception is thrown if one try to save a shapefile with
    mixed geometries (otherwise the user wonders when only polygons are stored)
  - fixed a bug in Simple Query (responsible of confusion between the
    three static taget options : all layers / selection / selected layers

  Many new translations
  
  Code clean up (fixed javadoc tags, removed duplicated imports, unused files)
