-----------------------------------

Version 1.2.0 F (released on 6.April.2008)

  This release includes

  New Features:
  
  - enabled transfer of attributes when Thiessen polygons are created
  - added category tools from Pirol Projekt
  - added function to copy current bounding box to clipboard.
  - added	Cut Polygon PlugIn from SIGLE
  - added new point style modifier and fill/nofill capability to custom symbols (like Triangle).
  - Added ImportSLD plugin. 
  - added SLD-Export of SVG images.
  - added a Paste Items At Point menu item on the layer view context
             menu that pastes the clipboard at the right-clicked point.  Note 
             that there must be an editable layer highlighted.  
  - added Replace attribute value by copy from an other attribute 
            org.openjump.sigle.plugin.replace.ReplaceValuePlugIn.java   
  - added Extract by Geometry Type on layer name context menu.         
  - added the LayerPropertiesPlugIn which adds a menu item
            "Layer Properties" to the Layer Name popup menu.  This
            feature will display layer information such as name, number
            of features, number of points, number of attributes, geometry type,
            DataSource class, and source path.  It works on single or multiple
            layer selections.  It also includes a transparency adjustment slider
            that works for layer selections.
  - added an option to "Write world file" in the Save Image As dialog.
		  I18N strings were added but need translation.
		  com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.plugin.SaveImageAsPlugIn.java
		  org.openjump.core.ui.plugin.file.WorldFileWriter.java
  - Consolodated Label Style enhancements (from SkyJUMP).
        * Finished implementation of horizontal alignment in LabelStyle.
          Replaced the vertical alignment images (Above the line, etc.) with I18N text.
        * Added support for halo text. A halo is a surrounding outline in a
          contrasting color to improve readability when using a mixed background
        * Added support for hiding text below a specified scale.  This makes it possible
          to stop text from rendering when zoomed out too far to actually read it
  - added a Zoom Realtime tool to the toolbar.  This tool uses
          image stretching to simulate the zoom before it occurs for an
          accurate preview.
                       
  Changes in the user interface:
  
  - replaced "Transfer Attributes" from SIGLE with Spatial Join from JUMP
  - renamed CutPolygonPlugIn to SplitPolygonPlugIn 
  - added capability to use external graphics as fill patterns.
  - added support for halos (text outlines).
  - added a shift key mode to Move Selected Items cursor tool that 
             turns it into Rotate Selected Items.
  - added the new Open File, Open Project and Open Recent menus.
  - added drag and drop support for loading files
  - added mouse wheel zooming to the PanTool. 
  - added the SelectablePlugIn to control selectability of layers.
  - moved Layer Properties below Selectable menu item.
  - added menu icons to MoveLayerablePlugIn, BufferPlugIn, and RefreshDataStoreLayerPlugin
  - added menu icons to EditablePlugIn and RotatePlugIn
  - added menu icons to Save Selected Datasets,Save Dataset As,
          Delete Selected Items, Delete All Features, Remove Selected Layers,
	  Add New Features, Zoom To Layer, and Cut Selected Items.
  - improved Tools->Generate->Buffer.
          Supports buffering the selection. Provides a convenience union option.
          Sidebar picture  previews the current options.  It copies attributes by
          default, even from selections on multiple layers, but this can beturned off.
          Supports setting the number of segments in a quarter circle.
  - added a VertexZValue style and internationalized the VertexXYLineSegment style
  - Make snap points to the grid or to vertices possible
  - Added a Segment Downhill Arrrow Style
    
          
  Fixes and performance improvements:
  
  - workaround for warping bug [1920024]   	  
  - replaced JTS version 1.72 by 1.9
  - replaced old PostgreSQL driver (v.2) by newer Version 3.0 
  - fixed bug of non-activation of Item-Info-Button in Attribute Table
  - fixed bug when exporting svg symbols via menu item.

       enables offline working with local WMSs.
  - fixed File->Save View as Raster bug with the Metal L&F that caused
            the save file name text box to dissappear.  Moved the Save World File
            check box to the top of the dialog.  Also added an X edit box that
            defaults to the view's X width, but can be changed to any value up to
            3800 to save a high resolution image.  A fence icon appears to the left
            of the X box if there is a fence layer, indicating taht it will be
            used in place of the view window to define the picture bounds.        
  - improved the PastePlugin to support point coordinates in the form (1.0,1,1)
       or (1 1 1) with any amount of white space. Multiple points can be pasted
       at the same time.

          layer name in the file chooser
  - Bug fixed in LoadDatasetPlugIn : refresh the file list each time the
          plugin is called
  - added -state command line option to specify a directory where
          the workbench-state.xml file should be stored (or a file name).
        * Updated the openjump.sh script to set the -state directory to
          $HOME/.jump/.
  - improvements to Simple Query: Put resulting layer in standard Result category,
          and added a listener to update comboboxes when
          layers are added to the task
  - added right click on Layer View menu item "Select Layers with Selected Items".
          Made setSelectedLayers() public in TreeLayerNamePanel to support this function.
  - fixed the internal string problem in DbfFile reader with large datasets where
          every attribute value was different by adding exception handler
          that stops further interns
  - fixed the problem with the toolbar selection arrow tool

          popup menu item.  It was totally nonfunctional.

-----------------------------------

Version 1.2.0 D (16.Aug.2007)

this version is equivalent to following nightly built: openjump-20070816-0019

Bugfixes and Improvements done since release of OpenJUMP 1.2 B:

- fixed a problem with the window turning black when an Image Layer was added due to the graphics context composite being changed.
- added support for mouse wheel zooming when the zoom cursor is over 
- set default SRID to -1 for PostGIS
- fixed a bug (submitted by Hisaji Ono) where some edges had
          wrong links to faces. The method has been entirely rewritten.
- added a warning message in language files to manage the case where one tries to transfer attributes from an heterogeneous layer with PlanarGraphPlugIn
- fixed a bug in Simple Query PlugIn (responsible of confusion between the
          three static taget options : all layers / selection / selected layers

- ShapefileWriter: added that an Exception is thrown, when layer geometries are of different type. 
		  Data aren't saved then. (otherwise the user wonders when only polygons are stored)
- removed openjump-mac.sh file since the new openjump.sh
          file works under MAC-OSX as well
- set EditTransaction.ROLLING_BACK_INVALID_EDITS_KEY = true when starting up
          OJUMP (i.e. invalid geometries are not alowed per default, switch can be
          done in Edit Options Panel)
- Tried to fix issue
          http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1246588&group_id=118054&atid=679906
          instead fixed the issue for SaveImageAsSVGPlugin and SaveProjectAsPlugin.
- Added context menu entry on layer list that allows changing the layer name.
          Changed ToggleVisibilityPlugin to allow changing WMS layer visibility
          toggling.
- The WMS field remembers the last used server address.
- resolved LoadDatasetPlugIn "ok" button problem on MacOSX.
          The problem was caused by the validation method that always
          returned false. The workaround does not use validation, but
          only for MacOSX computers. To check the OS a new class was added.
- WMS layers use the title now instead of the WMS layer name.
          While editing WMS requests, moving layers up/down caused the SRS
          box to switch back to the first available SRS, this was fixed.
- updated the demo.deegree.org URL to a working value.
- Default output is UTF-8 now instead of ISO-8859-1, fixing encoding
          problems in resulting XML files.
- added fix by Malte to avoid null-pointer excpetion when making a copy of a
          FeatureCollection containing Features with null values for attributes.
          (see jpp-devel email send by sstein on 24.July.2007)
- replaced jmat_5.0.jar by the cleaned up version jmat_5.0m.jar wich does only
          contain the org.jmat packages. 
- Bug fix in LabelStyle : added trim() to avoid labels to be ex-centered
- Bug fix : thick closed lines (and polygons) did not have a nice
          join_bevel on the first/last point (tip from Larry Becker)
- improvement: scripts/openjump.sh: Added improved startup script for Unix from
          Paul Austin.
- improvement: Add UnionByAttributePlugIn in the Tool/Analysis menu
- Remove several plugins related to loading/saving files and which are
          no more useful (two plugins in the workbench.ui.plugin package and
          two other plugins in the datasource package)
- improvement: Add automatic file extension in the main SaveDatasetAsPlugIn
          and put the format chooser at the bottom of the dialog (as in SkyJUMP)
- Fix a bug in the Comparator used to sort geometries and
          improve union performance.
- improvement: for expensive BasicStyle construction (slowed down colour theming a lot)
- improvement: added dissolve beanshell script by Hisaji
- Fix a problem with TaskFrame
          closing (related to bug 1726629) : now, every internal frames
          related to a TaskFrame (table view or info frame) are closed
          before the TaskFrame (with a confirmation dialog)
- Fix the "Closing Cloned Window" bug (1475013) : now, layer manager
          resources are released only when the last internal frame using it
          is closed.
- Fix bug 1691834 about labelling (can label above, on are below
          lines again)
- improvement: Backport Larry's bug-fix to enable
          workbench-properties file outside the IDE (see bug 1726102)
- Fix     Add double-quotes around column names to be able to query
          mixed-case column names. There may be a similar bug for schema
          and table names (see bug report 1694304), but this happens
          somewhere else in the code.
- improvement:
          Several optimization to be able to visualize data as wireframes
          while dragging the zoombar, even with big features and large
          dataset (use of Java2DConverter decimator, selection of large
          data instead of random data, elimination of invisible layers in
          the feature selection...)
- improvement: Including SkyJUMP's improvements concerning the rendering pipeline (point
          coordinates decimation, selection renderer)
- Fix the memory leak problem
          when removing a Layer (the LayerRender cache was not freed)
- Improvement: Cache last WMS result with a SoftReference
- Improvement: Union can now union a layer or a selection, like
          in SkyJUMP
- Improve segments extracter -> optionally removes segments
          appearing several times like the JCS equivalent plugin and
          optionally merge the result)
- fixed bug: line width textField set on the same line as the line
          width slider in the basic style panel
- fixed bug: "End feathers" decoration appeared on wrong end
